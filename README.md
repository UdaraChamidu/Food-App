# Recipe Application

This is a Recipe Application built using React that allows users to search for recipes, view detailed information about each recipe, save favorite recipes, and much more. The app uses an API to fetch recipe data and provides a responsive, user-friendly experience.

## Features

### Search Functionality
- Users can input keywords to search for recipes.
- A debounce function is implemented to optimize API calls as users type.

### Recipe Listing
- Recipes are displayed in a grid or list format with images, titles, and brief descriptions.
- Pagination or infinite scrolling is implemented for a smooth user experience.

### Recipe Details Page
- A dedicated page for each recipe, which includes:
  - Ingredients list with quantities and images.
  - Cooking instructions in a step-by-step format.
  - Nutritional information (calories, fats, proteins, etc.).
  - User ratings and reviews (if applicable).

## Technologies & Tools

- **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between different pages (e.g., home, recipe details).
- **Axios/Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the recipe API.
- **CSS Modules/Styled Components**: For modular styling.
- **Context API/Redux**: For state management.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizing hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks.

## Concepts Covered

- **Component Lifecycle**: Understanding how components mount, update, and unmount.
- **State Management**: Managing local state and lifting state up.
- **API Integration**: Handling API responses, errors, and managing loading states.
- **Form Handling**: Validating user input and managing form inputs.
- **Testing**: Writing unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the app on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
